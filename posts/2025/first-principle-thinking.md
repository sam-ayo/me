I've always been a very inquisitive person, and I sometimes get challenged for asking too many questions—lol—but asking "why" is fundamental to who I am. This curiosity has led me to think about and explore many ideas. Often, I discover that someone else is already tackling the problem and doing a great job. However, what I’ve noticed is that when I ask “why,” it usually reveals a fundamental gap in my own knowledge that I need to fill.

That knowledge is likely already out there, meaning I need to explore further to find it—or, in some cases, discover the solution myself. This is one of the reasons I believe thinking from the ground up is a powerful optimization technique. Many of the best algorithms in computer science were discovered this way—dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, sliding windows, etc.

While researching this idea, I learned that this is also how Elon Musk actually approaches problem-solving, and he's been vocal about it too, which I found really inspiring.
