heyy :)) Glad to have you read about me. My name is Samuel Adeoye. I am a software engineer with over 4 years software development experience.
I graduated top of my class with a Bsc. Honors Computer Science from the Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's Canada.
I have a strong background in computer science fundamental and I have queued up a lot of knowledge over the years.

You can catch me writing typescript, tinkering with databases, creating new software applications.
